	// Phase is a partial step in an object's reconciliation

	// As an example a Knative object's reconciliation may require
	// that N Kubernetes objects are created. A reconciler can be
	// composed with N phases where each phase is responsible for
	// reconciling a single Kubernetes resource. This abstraction
	// is intended to help manage a reconciler's complexity.
	//
	// Phases can specify what should trigger reconcilation by
	// conforming to the 'WithTriggers' interface. eg:
	//
	//	func (p *myPhase) Triggers() []reconciler.Trigger {
	//		return []reconciler.Trigger{{
	//			ObjectKind:  corev1.SchemeGroupVersion.WithKind("Service"),
	//			EnqueueType: reconciler.EnqueueObject,
